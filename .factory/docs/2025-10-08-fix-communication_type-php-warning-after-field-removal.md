# Fix PHP Warning: Missing communication_type After Field Removal

## Problem Analysis

After removing the `client_communication` field, there's a PHP warning because the `handleFormSubmission` method is still trying to access `$payload['communication_type']` which no longer exists.

### Current Issue:
- **Line 443**: `$communicationType = $payload['communication_type'];` causes "Undefined array key" warning
- **Lines 540-544**: Communication logging logic still uses the missing `$communicationType` variable
- **Functionality Impact**: Communication logging is broken due to missing type

### Root Cause:
The communication logging system was designed to log when the communication type changes, but since we removed the `client_communication` field (which duplicated `client_status` values), we need to adapt it to use `client_status` instead.

## Solution Plan

### 1. Fix the Missing Key Reference
- Replace `$payload['communication_type']` with `$clientData['client_status']` 
- This uses the client status which contains the same values the communication field had

### 2. Update Communication Logging Logic
- Modify the condition to check if client status is provided
- Use client status for communication logging instead of the removed communication type
- Maintain the existing communication history functionality

### 3. Preserve Communication History
- The `ClientCommunicationsModel` remains intact (full communication logging table)
- Only the source of the communication type changes from removed field to client status
- Historical communication records are preserved

### 4. Validate the Fix
- Ensure no more PHP warnings
- Verify communication logging still works with client status changes
- Test that the `getLatestCommunicationType` comparison functions correctly

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify:
- **`app/Controllers/ClientsController.php`**
  - Line 443: Replace `$payload['communication_type']` with `$clientData['client_status']`
  - Lines 540-544: Update communication logging to use client status
  - Add null check for empty status values

### Benefits:
- ✅ Eliminates PHP warning
- ✅ Maintains communication logging functionality  
- ✅ Uses existing data (client status) instead of redundant field
- ✅ Preserves communication history tracking
- ✅ Aligns with business logic (status changes are communication events)

This fix maintains the valuable communication logging feature while eliminating the redundant form field and resolving the PHP warning.
